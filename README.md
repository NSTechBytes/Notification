# Rainmeter Notification Plugin

This Rainmeter plugin provides a way to display custom notifications with configurable titles, text, icons, sounds, and actions. It can be triggered via Rainmeter skin actions, and can execute custom commands when the notification is clicked.

## Features

- Display notifications with customizable **Title**, **Text**, and **Icon**.
- Play **Sound** when the notification appears.
- Execute a custom **action** when the notification is clicked.
- Supports both system icons and custom icons (`.ico` files).
- Configurable notification behavior through the Rainmeter skin.

## Installation

### 1. Clone or Download the Plugin

Clone this repository or download the plugin DLL file.

### 2. Add the Plugin to Rainmeter

Place the compiled `Notification.dll` file into your Rainmeter `Plugins` directory:
```
<Rainmeter Directory>\Plugins
```

### 3. Use the Plugin in Your Skin

In your Rainmeter skin `.ini` file, you can define the notification using the `[mNotification]` measure. Here is an example configuration:

```ini
[mNotification]
Measure=Plugin
Plugin=Notification
Title=This is Title
Text=This is custom Text
Icon="path to Icon.ico"
Sound=Default

```

### Parameters:

- **Title**: The title of the notification.
- **Text**: The text content of the notification.
- **Icon**: The path to a custom icon `.ico` file (optional). If not provided, the default system icon will be used.
- **Sound**: The sound to play when the notification appears. Options:
  - `Default`: Play the default system notification sound.
  - `<PathToSoundFile>`: Specify a custom `.wav` or `.mp3` file.
  - `None`: No sound will play.
- **LeftMouseUpAction**: The action to execute when the notification is clicked. For example, you can trigger a Rainmeter bang or any other action.

## Example Usage

Here is an example of a full Rainmeter skin that shows how to use the plugin to display a notification with a custom title, text, icon, and sound:

```ini
[Rainmeter]
Update=1000
BackgroundMode=2
SolidColor=255,255,255,150

[mNotification]
Measure=Plugin
Plugin=Notification
Title=This is Title
Text=This is custom Text
Icon="#ROOTCONFIGPATH#Icon.ico"
Sound=Default

[Text]
Meter=STRING
MeasureName=mNotification
X=120
Y=20
W=220
FontColor=000000
Antialias=1
stringAlign = CenterCenter
clipString = 2
Text="ðŸ”” Click Me To Generate a Custom Notification ðŸŽ‰"
LeftMouseUpAction=[!RainmeterPluginBang "mNotification ExecuteBatch 1"]
```

When the skin is loaded, it will display the notification with the title **Reminder** and text **Don't forget to check the dashboard!**. When the user clicks the notification, it will trigger the defined `LeftMouseUpAction`.
